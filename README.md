## 📝 Outline
This analysis investigates operational performance across hospitals using 2023 healthcare data. It explores billing by medical conditions, medication counts, test results, and doctor performance to uncover actionable insights for improving healthcare quality, cost-efficiency, and patient satisfaction.

---

## 📖 Introduction
The Healthcare Analysis Dashboard was developed to evaluate patient outcomes, billing behavior, and institutional performance across various health centers. Using Microsoft Excel, this dashboard translates complex datasets into understandable visuals and metrics for stakeholders in healthcare management.

---

## 📂 Story of Data
The dataset contains information on:
- Medical conditions billed and their costs
- Patient test results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive)
- Hospital-level medication distribution
- Doctor-level performance (number of cases handled)
- Insurance provider billing amounts

Data was compiled to highlight healthcare resource usage, cost distribution, and quality indicators.

---

## 🔀 Data Splitting and Preprocessing
Data was segmented by:
- Medical Condition
- Hospital
- Doctor
- Test Result
- Insurance Provider

Cleaning tasks included:
- Correcting mislabeled hospital names (e.g., “Hospital 1”)
- Standardizing billing formats
- Handling missing values in billing amounts

---

## 📊 Pre-Analysis
- **Independent Variables**: Hospital name, Doctor, Insurance Provider, Medical Condition, Test Result
- **Dependent Variables**: Billing Amount, Medication Count, Patient Volume
- **Stakeholders**: Hospital Management, Insurance Companies, Public Health Authorities
- **Success Metrics**: Patient satisfaction, Revenue efficiency, Diagnostic accuracy, and Medication balance

---

## 📈 In-Analysis
### Key Observations
- Diabetes and Hypertension had the highest billing values.
- Michael Smith had the highest patient count.
- Cedars-Sinai and Cleveland Clinic led in medication distribution.
- Houston Methodist generated over half of the total revenue from top hospitals.
- Medicare billed the most among all insurance providers.
- High normal test results, but concerning abnormal rates persist.

---

## 🧠 Post-Analysis and Insights
- Chronic conditions are top cost drivers.
- Some hospitals clearly outperform others in service and financial outcomes.
- Certain doctors have exceptionally high performance metrics.
- Identical insurance billing values may indicate fraud, errors, or rigid coverage plans.
- Data inconsistency (e.g., Hospital 1) weakens the reliability of some reports.

---

## 📉 Data Visualizations & Charts
The dashboard includes:
- Billing amount by medical condition (bar chart)
- Test result distribution (donut chart)
- Medication count by hospital (column chart)
- Top doctors by cases handled (bar chart)
- Billing share by insurance providers (pie chart)

---

## 💡 Recommendations and Observations
- Expand preventive programs for Diabetes and Hypertension.
- Use high-performing hospitals and doctors as benchmarks.
- Improve reporting accuracy by standardizing hospital data inputs.
- Collaborate with top insurance providers for efficient policy design.
- Investigate identical billing patterns for Aetna and Cigna.
- Align medication stock with hospital-level patient needs.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
The Healthcare Dashboard has revealed valuable insights into operational strengths and weaknesses in the medical system. Leveraging these findings can boost performance, optimize resource use, and deliver better patient outcomes in future healthcare strategies.
